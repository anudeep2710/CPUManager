# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project is a CPU scheduling simulator implemented in Java. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for inputting process details, selecting scheduling policies, running simulations, and visualizing scheduling results using Gantt charts.

## Features

- Supports three scheduling policies: Shortest Job First (SJF), First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), and Round Robin.
- Allows users to input process details including process ID, arrival time, and burst time.
- Enables users to select the number of simulations and seed value for random number generation.
- Displays scheduling results using Gantt charts.
- Calculates and displays statistics such as average waiting time, average turnaround time, maximum waiting time, and minimum turnaround time.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
4. Use the GUI to input process details, select scheduling policies, and run simulations.
5. View the scheduling results and Gantt charts displayed in the GUI.
6. Check the console for calculated statistics.

## Dependencies

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Swing library for GUI components
